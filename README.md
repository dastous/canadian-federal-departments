# candian-federal-departments-website

Have you ever wonder about why is it so difficult to find anything on Canadians websites? 
Have you ever wonder where you should look for relevant and meaningful information, but end up not finding what you were looking for? 
Or perhaps you wonder why you stubble on content written in 2002? 
Or perharps you wonder why you end up on so many broken links?

I crawled a dozen canadians government websites and made an inventory of their links.

This is a work in progress..
